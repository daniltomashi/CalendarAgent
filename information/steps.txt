Done:
    - Get access to API

In progress:
    1. Find event with specific conditions
    2. Understand how relevant this event (how accurate in terms of probability does this event with this conditions has)
    3. If probability >= threshold, then procced

Actual steps:
    1. Give prompt for LLM. Example:
            "If I have today any meetings, then change it to the nearest available time tomorrow after 12:00 and up to 19:00. Also in description write down
             that due to family circumstances we should change it"
    2. Based on prompt we should create structured output with next field (not all of them should be filled)
            Fields (use Pydentic for it):
                - date
                - person (we have meeting with)
                - change_to (change to another date or time)
                - description (left the same or change it)

Bigger idea:
    - train my own model, instead of using API
